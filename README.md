## Main Ambitions

1. Create open source **Rust** alternative to Postman or Insomnia software.
2. Based on provided Jinja2 templated specification and variables perform series of endpoint tests
3. Test should support:
    1. Checking response code and body
    2. Performing preparation and cleaning actions
    3. Benchmarking
    4. Verbosed output for debugging
